# CS683 Project  - Loan Payment Calculator Application

A simple utility application to calculate the payment of an amortizing loan. 
The application contains the following activities:

## Calculate Loan Payment
The user will enter in the details of the loan, including: 
1. Loan amount
2. number of payments
3. Periodic interest rate
4. Extra principle payment _(Optional)_
  
The user will then press the submit button and the loan payment information will be displayed, including:
1. Monthly payment amount
2. Total cost of loan
3. Total interest paid

## Display Amortization Schedule
Once a loan amount is calculated, the user can swipe left to display the amortization schedule. The amortization schedule will display a table containing a row for each loan installment, including:
1. Payment No.
2. Balance (start)
3. Payment amount due
4. Principle amount
5. Interest amount
6. Balance (end)
  
At the bottom of the table a _Print_ button will allow the user to print the current table to PDF. The PDF may then be printed, saved, or eported.

## Display Loan Details
Once a loan amount is calculated, the user can _swipe right_ to display a graphical representation of the loan details in the form of a _Donut Graph_, by displaying the __Total Cost__ of the loan and breaks out the amounts paid to __Principle__ and __Interest__ respectively.
